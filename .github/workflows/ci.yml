# This is the configuration file for our CI via Github Actions.

# The result of all executions of the github actions is logged in the "Actions" tab at the top of
# the repository. If the jobs aren't running as they should, check there to see if you didn't
# introduce a syntax error in the YAML file or something like that.

name: Github Actions CI

# Github Actions can be infuriatingly obtuse at times. I don't know exactly why we need both the
# push and the pull_request events. It's wasteful, but at least does what we want.
#
# - only push:         doesn't run checks if an external fork opens a pull request
# - only pull_request: doesn't work with caching
# - both events:       runs the same checks twice, wasting compute time
on:
    push:
        branches: [ master ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]
