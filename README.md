# Pallene
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene/workflows/Github%20Actions%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene/actions)

Pallene is a statically typed and ahead-of-time compiled sister language to
[Lua](https://www.lua.org), with a focus on performance.
It is intended for writing performance sensitive code that interacts with
Lua, a space that is currently filled by C modules and by LuaJIT. Compared to
C, Pallene should offer better support for interacting with Lua data types,
bypassing the unfriendly syntax and performance overhead of the Lua-C API.
Compared to LuaJIT, Pallene aims to offer more predictable run-time performance.

## Installing Pallene

Pallene requires a special version of Lua, which you will need to build from source.
You will also need to install the Luarocks package manager.

### Install the special Lua

You must download and compile the Lua from [our other repository](https://www.github.com/pallene-lang/lua-internals).
This version of Lua is patched to expose some additional C APIs that Pallene needs.

```sh
git clone https://www.github.com/pallene-lang/lua-internals/
cd lua-internals
make linux-readline -j4
sudo make install
```

To check if you have installed the right version of Lua, run `lua -v`.
It needs to say `Lua 5.x.x with core API`.
If it doesn't have the "with core API", that means you're using vanilla Lua.

### Install Luarocks

The next step is to get the Luarocks package manager.
Because we built our Lua from source, we must also [build Luarocks from source](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Installation-instructions-for-Unix).
You can't download Luarocks from your Linux distro, because that would use the wrong version of Lua.
To build Luarocks, unpack the sources and run `configure`, `make`, and `make install`.
In the configure step, use `--with-lua` to point to our special Lua.

```sh
wget https://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-3.9.0.tar.gz
tar xf luarocks-3.9.0.tar.gz
cd luarocks-3.9.0
./configure --with-lua=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```

By default, Luarocks installs packages into /usr/local, which requires sudo.
If you prefer to install to your home directory by default, enable the `local_by_default` setting.

```sh
luarocks config local_by_default true
```

Remember that in order for the local rocks tree to work, you must to set the PATH and LUA_PATH environment variables.

```sh
# Add this line to your ~/.bashrc
eval "$(luarocks path)"
```

### Install Pallene

Finally, we can use Luarocks to build and install the Pallene compiler.
This will also download and install the necessary Lua libraries.

```sh
luarocks make pallene-dev-1.rockspec
```

## Using Pallene

To compile a `foo.pln` file to a `foo.so` module, call `pallenec` as follows.

```sh
pallenec foo.pln
```

The resulting `foo.so` can be loaded via the usual `require` mechanism.

```sh
lua -l foo
```

It is possible to change the compiler optimization level, for the Pallene compiler and C compiler.
Here are some examples:

```sh
# execute no optimization (Pallene and C compiler)
pallenec test.pln -O0

# execute Pallene compiler optimizations and C compiler level 3 optimizations
pallenec test.pln -O3

# execute no optimizations for Pallene compiler but executes C compiler level 2 optimizations
env CFLAGS="-O2" pallenec test.pln -O0

# execute all default optimizations (same as -O2)
pallenec test.pln
```

**Note**: For the C compiler only, the setting set using `CFLAGS` overrides the setting set by flag `-O`.

For more compiler options, see `pallenec --help`

and how to configure your text editor to preserve our style standard.
