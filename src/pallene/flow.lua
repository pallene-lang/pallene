-- Functions for doing flow analysis
--
-- The flow.lua file is designed as an API that helps doing flow analysis.
--
-- We give a brief introduction of flow analysis just to get the reader acquainted with the
-- terminology being used here. To better understand the code you should know how flow analys work
-- already.
--
-- Flow Analysis introduction:
--
-- Doing flow analysis on a function consists of tracking down properties of it's code along each
-- command. These properties are represented using a set. Each basic block has a "start" set and a
-- "finish" set. The "start" set is the set of values available right before we start to process the
-- block's commands and the "finish" set is the set of values available right after we finish
-- processing the commands. Each block also has a "kill" and a "gen" set that help transform the
-- "start" set into the "finish" set. The "kill" set contains the values that will be removed from
-- the running set while "gen" (as in "generate") contains the values that will be added to it. The
-- flow analysis algorithm's input is a pair of "kill" and "gen" sets for each block and the initial
-- values for the "start" sets of each block. During it's runtime, the algorithm updates the "start"
-- and "finish" sets in a loop until they all converge to some value. The algorithm requires a loop
-- because a block's "start" set depends on the "finish" set of it's predecessor or it's successors,
-- depending on what order the flow analysis is being done (some analyses require that we walk
-- through the code backwards).
--
--
-- API usage:
--
-- When doing flow analysis, follow these steps. Also look at examples of usage inside the codebase,
-- as in "gc.lua".
--
--  1) Create a function of type "function (set, block id)" that will be used internally by the API
--  to initialize the "start" sets. The function is called once for each basic block. It's first
--  argument is the "start" set of the block and the second is the block's index.
--
--  2) Create function of type "function (FlowState, block id, command id)" that will be used for
--  updating the running set as we read the function's commands. The first argument is an object
--  of type FlowState, that stores various sets used internally; the second argument is the
--  block index and the third is the command's index inside the block. For removing/adding
--  elements from/to the set, use the API function "flow.kill_value" for removal
--  and "flow.gen_value" for insertion. Both functions are of type "function (FlowState,
--  element)", where the first argument is a FlowState object and the second is the element
--  that will be removed/inserted from/into the set.
--
--  3) Create a FlowInfo object
--      The object's constructor takes three parameters:
--          order:
--              The order in which commands and blocks are iterated during flow analysis.
--              "Order.Forwards" updates the running set by reading a block's commands in order and
--              builds the "start" set of a block from it's predecessors' "finish" sets, while
--              "Order.Backwards" updates the running set by reading a block's commands in backwards
--              order and builds the "start" set of a block from it's successors' "finish" sets.
--          process_cmd:
--              function used to update the running set, use the one you wrote in step 2
--          init_start:
--              function used to initalize the "start" set of blocks, use the one you wrote in
--              step 1
--
--  4) Call the function "flow.flow_analysis". It's parameters are:
--      func_block:
--          A list of the function's blocks
--      flow_info :
--          An object of type "FlowInfo". Use the one you created in step 3.
--
--  "flow.flow_analysis" returns a list of objects of type "FlowState.Build". Each basic block has a
--  corresponding object on the list.
--
--  5) Having now the list of flow states, iterate through blocks and commands (if you used
--  Order.Backwards previously, in step 3, then you'll have to iterate through the commands of the
--  block backwards too).
--
--    5.1) Inside the loop that iterates over blocks and before entering the loop that iterates over
--    the commands of a block, call "flow.make_apply_state". The function receives one argument,
--    which will be the flow state of the current block that can retrieved from the list obtained in
--    step 4 (e.g. the flow state corresponding to the 3rd block will be flow_state_list[3]).
--    "flow.make_apply_state" returns an object of type "FlowState.Apply". This one will be used to
--    update the state of the flow analysis set as we iterate over the commands of the current
--    block. This set can be accesses through the "set" property of the "FlowState.Apply" object
--    returned by "flow.make_apply_state". Checking the contents of this set as you update it
--    throught the commands is essentialy the whole point of everything we're doing here, that's
--    what flow analysis is for. The "set" property of the "FlowState.Apply" object returned by
--    "flow.make_apply_state" is equal the "start" set of the current block.
--
--    5.2) Inside the loop that iterates over a block's commands, call "flow.update_set" to update
--    the set of the "FlowState.Apply" object. "flow.update_set"'s first argument is the
--    "FlowState.Apply" object; second argument is the FlowInfo object created in step 3; third
--    argument is the current block's index and the forth argument is the current command's index
--    inside the block.
